# Exercise-06b-Networked-Game
Exercise for MSCH-C220, 12 April 2021

A simple networked game

To play, load two copies of this exercise in Godot. Run one and press the Host Game button. Then load the second copy and press the Join Game button. The position of the players will be relayed over the network (over localhost) from one copy to the other. Each player can be controlled (using WASD) depending on which window is selected.

I completed this assignment, I went on both copies of the game and moved the pieces around but I got an error message trying to push the it back to the repository so just in case know that I did do it.
